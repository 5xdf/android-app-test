- Application has a testing flag
    
## Other useful features
- Dependency injection (with [Dagger v2](http://google.github.io/dagger/))
- Reactive programming with [Kotlin Flows](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html)
- Google [Material Design](https://material.io/blog/android-material-theme-color) library
- Logging (with [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber))
- Android architecture components to share ViewModels during configuration changes
- Resource defaults
    - themes.xml

# Getting started

1. Download this repository extract and open the template folder on Android Studio
2. Rename the app package `io.bloco.template`
3. Check if the manifest package was renamed along with the package
4. On `app`, change the package on the `mode` lazy var
5. On `app/build.gradle`, change the applicationId to the new app package
6. On `app/build.gradle`, update the dependencies Android Studio suggests
7. On `string.xml`, set your application name
8. On `theme.xml` & `colors.xml` set your application primary and secondary colors 

And you're ready to start working on your new app.

# Notes
- Make sure the method `checkTestMode` inside `AndroidApplication` includes a test class
  that exists
- By choice jetifier enabled inside `gradle.properties`. Even do its not necessary for the current decencies, this was left so 
newcomers can grab the template and start using it without worrying when to turn it on.
 We do recommend you to check [Can I drop Jetifier?](https://github.com/plnice/can-i-drop-jetifier) when expanding the template.

### üìù To Do

- Hilt Dependency Manager
- Gesture Navigation compatibility 
- Styles.xml Styles-Text.xml
- TestAppComponent for easier Injection and Reverse Injection
- Github CI Actions [Unit Tests, Lint, Instrumented _(pre configured for easy setup)_]
- Rename Template Script
- Real World Example Application Branch
